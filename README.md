# Protect Your Ears

For this project we collaborated using  CSS, Java Script and HTML to create a website that allows you to look up the lyrics, tour dates and billboard hits of hip hop artists. 
We used Spotify API to allow users visting the website to look up an artists discography. 
Our site opens up to our main page titled "Protect Your Ears" which was inspired by WU-Tang. At first glance on the page you will see a search bar and three boxes titled "Lyrics" "Tour" and "Biggest Hits". When you click on the Lyrics link it takes you to a separate HTML page that will display the lyrics to a song you are searching. Each link opens up to a separate html page correlating to the coresponding search results.
We ran into a few issues while doing git pulls from the main repository that resulted in code being overwritten and deleted. We were able to solve this issue by grabbing code from previous commits. Another issue we ran into was a paywall while trying to use Spotifys api for our search results


## Usage
This Website can be used to look up the Lyrics, Biggest Hits and Tour dates of your favorite artist.
